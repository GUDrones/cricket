# Position:
Given a max ball velocity of approximately 170 km/h = 47 m/s and for maximum height a trajectory of 90 degrees (directly upwards) then maximum height attained is<br>

$h_m+\frac{V_0^2\sin^2(α)}{2g}=113m=370ft$<br>

so we need to be hovering at approximately 113m, and a minimum field of view (FOV) of 80°
